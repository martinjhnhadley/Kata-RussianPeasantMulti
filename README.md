# NewOrbit Code Club: Kata Russian Peasant Multication
Weekly coding challenge - implementing a multiplication hack.

## Wolfram Language

KataMulti.wl includes a function `kataBasic` for calculating products via the Kata method, `kataFancy` visualises the technique and `kataExporter` exports a GIF of the technique. The solution is achieved through `NestWhileList`, checks for positive integers.

Load the package with

```
Needs["KataMulti`"]
```

KataMultiplicationExample.GIF is an example GIF exported from `kataExporter`.

## R

RKataScript.R includes a function `kataBasic` for calculating products via the Kata method. The solution is achieved through a conditional `While` loop.
